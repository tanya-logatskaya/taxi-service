![drawing](https://misadventureswithandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Taxis-in-New-York-City-New-York-USA.jpg)
### This project is designed to imitate the work of the simple taxi service app with driver authentication
During the first launch youâ€™re granted access to:
- login page for previously authorized users
- registration page

#### After registration, feel free to test full app functionality. Such as:
- creating manufacturers
- creating cars, using the list of existing manufacturers
- connecting drivers to cars, using related lists of options
- displaying all manufacturers, cars, or drivers
- displaying cars exclusively for the authorized drivers
- deleting manufacturers, cars, or drivers

1. Clone the project on your IDE
2. In MySQL Workbench run the script from resources/init_db_my.sql

Warning!!! if you already have a database named "taxi", this script will delete it and create a new database with the same name.

3. In src/main/java/taxi/util/ConnectionUtil change URL, USERNAME and PASSWORD with your data. JDBC Driver is already provided, but you can change it with a more suitable as well
4. In the src/main/resources/log4j2.xml at line File name = "File" fileName = "logs\app.log" replace "logs\app.log" with absolute path to .log file
