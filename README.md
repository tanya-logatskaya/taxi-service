![drawing](https://misadventureswithandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Taxis-in-New-York-City-New-York-USA.jpg)
### This project is designed to imitate the work of the simple taxi service app with driver authentication
During the first launch youâ€™re granted access to:
- login page for previously authorized users
- registration page

#### After registration, feel free to test full app functionality. Such as:
- creating manufacturers
- creating cars, using the list of existing manufacturers
- connecting drivers to cars, using related lists of options
- displaying all manufacturers, cars, or drivers
- displaying cars exclusively for the authorized drivers
- deleting manufacturers, cars, or drivers
